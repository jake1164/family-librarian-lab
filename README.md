# family-librarian-lab

Deterministic integration-test harness for [Family Librarian](https://github.com/jake1164/family-librarian),
built on top of [se-lab](https://github.com/Sydney-Elvis/se-lab).

## Status

This repo is a scaffold. It's the second consumer of se-lab, developed in parallel with the
m3undle-lab migration specifically so se-lab's abstractions get validated against two different
products before either is fully committed to — see se-lab's `.ai_docs/roadmap.md` (Phase 1b) for
the plan and current status.

se-lab is included as a git submodule at `se-lab/`. After cloning:

```
git submodule update --init
```
